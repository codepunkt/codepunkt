### About me

**Currently open for high impact hands-on work (IC or EM).**
Kickstarting technology and architecture, shaping systems, enabling delivery speed, and helping people do the best work of their careers.

The web has been my passion since 1996, when I built my first website. I love building great products, but I equally care about scalable architecture, tooling, automation, and systems that enable teams to move fast without compromising quality.

When I'm not deep in web or cloud technology, I spend time with my family or play videogames. I occasionally do freelance consulting in web security and write about Web Development, SaaS, and Cloud Architecture on my [blog](https://codepunkt.de).
