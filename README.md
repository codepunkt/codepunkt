### About me

I work as Director UI Engineering at [smartclip](https://smartclip.tv/). The web is my passion since 1996, when I developed my first website. I have a bachelor and a diploma in Computer Sciences, but everything I know about the web platform and cloud services today is self-taught. I consider myself blessed that I get to build great stuff and help others do the same for a living.

When not dabbling with web and cloud technology, Iâ€™m usually playing videogames or reading books or comics. I have slightly elitist views on beer, love to travel the world with my wife & daughter and have spent most of my adult life trying to get into a regular exercising habit. I believe in a culture that allows failure, supports experiments and celebrates learnings. I do some quality freelance consulting and teaching for Web Application Development, Web Security, SaaS and Cloud Architecture and write about Web Development and Cloud Technology on my [Blog](https://codepunkt.de/writing) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/code_punkt).
