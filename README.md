| I work as a Software Architect at [dSPACE](https://www.dspace.com/en/pub/home.cfm) where I support multiple scrum teams with web technologies and cloud architecture. I've been building for the web since 1996 and left a footprint in various industries. I live in Paderborn, Germany, where I organise the local JavaScript meetup.<br /><br />I'm curious, open-minded and love technology, UI and UX design and video games. I believe in a culture that allows failure, supports experiments and celebrates learnings. I do some quality consulting as a freelancer in the areas of web application development, SaaS and cloud migration and write about web development and cloud technology on my [Blog](https://codepunkt.de/writing) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/code_punkt). | <ul><li><a href="https://codepunkt.de/writing/generating-beautiful-open-graph-images-with-nodejs/">Generating beautiful Open Graph images with Node.js</a></li><li><a href="https://codepunkt.de/writing/how-to-set-up-syntax-highlighting-for-gatsby/">How to set up syntax highlighting for Gatsby</a></li><li><a href="https://codepunkt.de/writing/what-exactly-is-vanilla-js/">What exactly is vanilla JavaScript?</a></li></ul> |
